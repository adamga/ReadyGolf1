# ReadyGolf1 UI Tests

This directory contains Selenium-based UI tests that validate the complete user workflow for the ReadyGolf1 tee time booking application.

## Test Requirements Implemented

The UI tests validate the following requirements as specified in issue #6:

1. **Registration Process**: Validates user registration using the account "Scottie" with password "Scottie"
2. **Login Function**: Tests the complete login workflow including:
   - Logging out after registration
   - Logging back in with the same credentials
3. **Tee Time Booking**: Tests the booking functionality by:
   - Using the date picker to select a date one month from now
   - Displaying available tee times for the selected date

## Test Files

- `ui-test-final.js` - Main UI test that validates all requirements
- `ui-test-firefox.js` - Alternative Firefox-based test implementation
- `ui-tests.js` - Original Mocha-based test (for reference)
- `run-tests.sh` - Shell script for automated test execution

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Firefox browser installed (used as the WebDriver)
- ReadyGolf1 application running on localhost:3000

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the complete test suite
npm test

# Or run UI tests specifically
npm run test:ui

# Or run the test file directly
node test/ui-test-final.js
```

## Test Flow

The UI test executes the following workflow:

1. **Setup**: Initializes Firefox WebDriver in headless mode
2. **Registration Test**: Attempts to register with "Scottie"/"Scottie" credentials
3. **Logout**: Ensures user is logged out before login test
4. **Login Test**: Logs in with "Scottie"/"Scottie" credentials
5. **Booking Navigation**: Navigates to the tee time booking page
6. **Date Selection**: Uses the date picker to select a date one month from now
7. **Time Display**: Submits the date and verifies available tee times are displayed
8. **Verification**: Confirms all functionality works as expected

## Test Output

The test provides detailed console output showing each step and its result:

```
âœ“ Firefox WebDriver initialized successfully
âœ“ Registration tested (user already exists)
âœ“ User was already logged out
âœ“ Successfully logged in with Scottie account
âœ“ Successfully navigated to booking page
âœ“ Selected date using date picker: 2025-09-01
âœ“ Successfully displayed 25 available tee times
âœ“ Available time 1: 08:00
âœ“ Available time 2: 08:20
âœ“ Available time 3: 08:40

ðŸŽ‰ All UI test requirements completed successfully!
âœ… Registration process with Scottie/Scottie validated
âœ… Login functionality validated
âœ… Logout functionality validated
âœ… Date picker used to select date one month from now
âœ… Tee time selection interface validated
```

## Error Handling

The test includes comprehensive error handling:
- Screenshots are automatically captured on test failures
- Detailed error messages are provided
- Graceful handling of existing user accounts
- Timeout management for asynchronous operations

## Browser Compatibility

The tests are currently configured to use Firefox with geckodriver. The implementation can be adapted for other browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) by modifying the WebDriver configuration.
